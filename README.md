# myphotoshare v. 3.2
### A Web Photo Gallery Done Right via Static JSON & Dynamic Javascript
#### by Jason A. Donenfeld (<Jason@zx2c4.com>), Jerome Charaoui (jerome@riseup.net)  Joachim Tingvold (joachim@tingvold.com), Paolo Benvenuto (<paolobenve@gmail.com>)

## Description

`myphotoshare` is an open source web photo gallery aimed at sleekness and speed. It works over directory structures rather than esoteric photo database management software. Everything it generates is static, which means it's extremely fast.

Permits browsing the media by folder, date and geotags.

Content (albums, media files) can be shared over some popular social plaforms.

`myphotoshare` is a Jason A. Donenfeld's `photofloat` fork, enriched by Jerome Charaoui's patches permitting showing videos, and Paolo Benvenuto's following development.

[Check out a demo!](http://palmaro.qumran2.net/)

## Features

* Manages images and videos, and permits sharing them (single image or album)
* Media can be browsed by folder or by date
* Photos with gps data can be browsed by country/region-state/place; names are retrieves in choosen language from geonames.org web service:
* Switching among album, date and place views is permitted (with place whenever photo has gps data)
* Sharp images and thumbnails on mobile
* Fullscreen mode
* Metadata display
* Link to original media
* Link for direct download
* Animations to make the interface feel nice
* Separate album view and photo view
* Album metadata pre-fetching
* Photo pre-loading
* Recursive async randomized tree walking album thumbnail algorithm
* Smooth media scaling
* Consistent hash url format
* Optional Google Analytics and Piwik integration
* Optional server-side authentication support
* Many customization through config file
* Cache folder can be managed with subdirs (useful for large repositories)
* Albums server folder can be anywhere on the server
* Media and folders can be sorted ascending/descending by date or by name (via a cookie)
* Thumbnails can be square (cropped) or full-content
* Single `index.php` file (`php` needed because crawlers and social media do not execute javascript); `php` does a bit of work:
* - inserts link tag in <head></head> in order to let social media see the shared content
* - applies basic options to home page
* - insert proper parameters for analytics tracking
* Media animation when passing to next/previous image
* Folders (or trees) are not scanned if a marker in put inside them
* Verbosity levels can be set in scanner
* debug mode for using unminimized css's and js's

### Usability:

* Swipe gestures for mobile
* Keyboard navigation: arrows, pageup/down, esc, f (fullscreen), m (metadata)
* Mouse-wheel support
* Share buttons for `facebook`, `whatsapp` (mobile only), `twitter`, `google+`, `email`; on `facebook`, `whatsapp` and `google+`: a preview of the image/album is shared
* User interface translated via separate translation file

### Scanner times

As a term of comparizon, on my medium-sized pc, with the images on a nfs mounted nas partition:

* scanning for the first time a 124 photos directory for a total size of 295 MB takes about 100 seconds (about 1 sec/media, 1 media/sec).
* re-scan of "all OK" tree with 36000 media files for a total size of 87 GB takes about 14 minutes (about 20 ms/media, 50 media/sec)

### Known issues:

#### Issues related to previous scanner versions

##### Previous bug

The scanner had bug in the past, so thumbnail generated with previous versions of the scanner could have some defect or lack something:
* fixed height media thumbnails could result blurred
* video thumbnails could lack the transparent video marker

You can delete once for ever all the cache content, but perhaps you don't want to regenerate again all the thumbnails. The solution is to manually delete only the "failed" thumbnail.

As an example, the command to delete thumbnails of `mp4` videos is:

    find /your/cache/directory/ -iname "*mp4_*.jpg" -exec rm {} \;

Repeat the same command for other video extensions, like `avi`.

##### Added gps data

The scanner could not be able to add gps data if json files where generated by pre-gps (<= 2.8) versions; you must manually delete all the json files in cache folder in order to get them with all the needed data

#### ffmpeg/avconv version

Old `ffmpeg/avconv` could not be able to transcode some video. Be sure you have the last version installed.

#### Video date and time

The scanner gets modification date-time for video date-time. Be sure you do not modify it; or, if you modified it, touch it to desidered date-time.

## Community

Github platform permits you to report bugs.

## How It Works

``myphotoshare`` consists of two segments – a Python script and a JavaScript application.

The Python script scans a directory tree of images, whereby each directory constitutes an album. It then populates a second folder, known as the cache folder with statically generated JSON files and thumbnails. It writes an `options.json` file too in html root folder, putting inside it all the options from default config file or user config file. The scanner extracts metadata from EXIF tags in JPEG photos and other data from videos. Photofloat is smart about file and directory modification time, so you are free to run the scanner script as many times as you want, and it will be quite fast if there are few or zero changes since the last time you ran it.

The JavaScript application consists of a single `index.php` file with a single `scripts.min.js` and a single `styles.min.css`. It fetches the `options.json` file and the statically generated JSON files and thumbnails on the fly from the `cache` folder to create a speedy interface.

Photofloat features share buttons, and `php` permits to pass the shared image/video/album to social media.

It is, essentially, a slick and fast, minimal but still well-featured photo gallery app on the net, suitable for sharing your media with your friends.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Photofloat needs:

* `python` 2.7
* `avconv` / `ffmpeg` in order to be able to manage videos.
* a working web server (e.g. `apache`, `nginx`, etc.) with `php` module installed
* `php5-gd` in order to create albums share images
* `curl`, used by minify script

#### Why `php`? Isn't it enough with javascript?

`php` is *needed* for sharing, because social app do not execute any javascript when they receive an *URI*. Without `php`, sharing any page is perfectly equivalent to sharing the simple index.html: no information of the particular page you want to share is retained.

`php` does the job you need for sharing: `javascript` creates proper urls based on the page hash, and when a share button is pressed a parameter is passed to `php`, and it sets the proper html page title and appends the proper `<link rel='video_src' href="`video_link`">` or `<link rel='image_src' href="`image_link`">` tag to the `<head>` tag; this way the social media gets the data they need and show a preview of the media/album you are sharing.

### Download the source code from the git repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/paolobenve/myphotoshare.git
    $ cd myphotoshare

### Copy and tweak the configuration file

    $ sudo mkdir /etc/myphotoshare
    $ sudo cp myphotoshare.conf.defaults /etc/myphotoshare/myproject.conf
    $ sudo vim /etc/myphotoshare/myproject.conf

In your config file (myproject.conf, name can be whatever you want) you must set the proper folders for albums (your photo, they won't be modified) and cache (all the stuff `myphotoshare` requieres in order to work)

### Build the web page.

This simply minifies and concatenate everything of js and css.

    $ ./js-css-minify.sh

### Config your web server

Be sure you have a web server installed (`apache2`, `nginx`, ...), with `php` and `php5-gd` modules installed and set.

Be sure you installed `avconv` / `ffmpeg`.

The simplest way to configure the web server is:

* set `web` subdir as the root of your site
* `ln -s /absolute/path/to/your/albums/root albums`
* `mkdir cache` and give it proper permissions: `cache` must be writable by the scanner

However, "debian's way" could be better:

* clone `myphotoshare` repository in `/usr/share`, so that you end with a `/usr/share/myphotoshare` directory
* copy `myphotoshare.conf.defaults` to `/etc/myphotoshare` and properly config it
* in your web site root, put links to `myphotoshare` web folder files and directories: `css`, `favicon.ico`, `fonts`, `img`, `index.php`, `js`
* make sure the scanner has write access to your web site root

### (When `myphotoshare` code is updated) Update your `myphotoshare` installation

Go to the folder you cloned the repository in and execute:

    $ git pull https://github.com/paolobenve/myphotoshare.git
    $ ./js-css-minify.sh

Obviously the scanner should be launched too.

### Generate the albums:

When you're done run the static generator (you need Python≥2.6 and the Python Imaging Library; for video something like libav-conv is requiered too):

    $ /your/myphotoshare/installation/dir/scanner/main.py /etc/myphotoshare/myproject.conf

After it finishes, you will be all set. Simply have your web server serve pages out of your web directory. You may want to do the scanning step in a cronjob, if you don't use the deployment makefiles mentioned below.

Note: The albums web folder and the cache one could be anywhere in the file system or in web, the only requierement is that the web server has access to them.

#### `cron` file example:

You can automate the updating process, so that you don't need to worry of running the scanner, simply do whatever you want on your albums tree, and `myphotoshare` will be updated every night:

    # update myphotoshare cache
    58 1  * * * root    /your/myphotoshare/installation/dir/scanner/main.py /etc/myphotoshare/myproject.conf > /var/log/my-myphotoshare-project.log

Instead or running `myphotoshare` as root, you can use whatever user that have access to the directories you set up in your config file

## Optional: Server-side Authentication

The JavaScript application uses a very simple API to determine if a photo can be viewed or not. If a JSON file returns error `403`, the album is hidden from view. To authenticate, `POST` a username and a password to `/auth`. If unsuccessful, `403` is returned. If successful, `200` is returned, and the previously denied json files may now be requested. If an unauthorized album is directly requested in a URL when the page loads, an authentication box is shown.

`myphotoshare` ships with an optional server side component called FloatApp to faciliate this, which lives in `scanner/floatapp`. It is a simple Flask-based Python web application.

#### Edit the app.cfg configuration file:

    $ cd scanner/floatapp
    $ vim app.cfg

Give this file a correct username and password, for both an admin user and a photo user, as well as a secret token. The admin user is allowed to call `/scan`, which automatically runs the scanner script mentioned in the previous section.

#### Decide which albums or photos are protected:

    $ vim auth.txt

This file takes one path per line. It restricts access to all photos in this path. If the path is a single photo, then that single photo is restricted.

#### Configure nginx:

FloatApp makes use of `X-Accel-Buffering` and `X-Accel-Redirect` to force the server-side component to have minimal overhead. Here is an example nginx configuration that can be tweaked:

    server {                                                                                                               
            listen 80;                                                                                                     
            server_name photos.jasondonenfeld.com;                                                                         
            location / {
                    index index.html;
                    root /var/www/htdocs/photos.jasondonenfeld.com;
            }

            include uwsgi_params;
            location /albums/ {
                    uwsgi_pass unix:/var/run/uwsgi-apps/myphotoshare.socket;
            }
            location /cache/ {
                    uwsgi_pass unix:/var/run/uwsgi-apps/myphotoshare.socket;
            }
            location /scan {
                    uwsgi_pass unix:/var/run/uwsgi-apps/myphotoshare.socket;
            }
            location /auth {
                    uwsgi_pass unix:/var/run/uwsgi-apps/myphotoshare.socket;
            }
            location /photos {
                    uwsgi_pass unix:/var/run/uwsgi-apps/myphotoshare.socket;
            }

            location /internal-cache/ {
                    internal;
                    alias /var/www/uwsgi/myphotoshare/cache/;
            }
            location /internal-albums/ {
                    internal;
                    alias /var/www/uwsgi/myphotoshare/albums/;
            }
    }

Note that the `internal-*` paths must match that of `app.cfg`. This makes use of uwsgi for execution:

    metheny ~ # cat /etc/uwsgi.d/myphotoshare.ini
    [uwsgi]
    chdir = /var/www/uwsgi/%n
    master = true
    uid = %n
    gid = %n
    chmod-socket = 660
    chown-socket = %n:nginx
    socket = /var/run/uwsgi-apps/%n.socket
    logto = /var/log/uwsgi/%n.log
    processes = 4
    idle = 1800
    die-on-idle = true
    plugins = python27
    module = floatapp:app

## Optional: Deployment Makefiles

Both the scanner and the webpage have a `make deploy` target, and the scanner has a `make scan` target, to automatically deploy assets to a remote server and run the scanner. For use, customize `deployment-config.mk` in the root of the project, and carefully read the `Makefile`s to learn what's happening.

* added media count to subalbums slides
* only update json files and composite images if needed
* bug fixes

### version 2.6 (August 16, 2017):

* composite images for sharing albums are now generated by scanner (not by php any more);
* new option `cache_album_subdir`: the subdir of cache_path where the album composite images will be saved
* new option `video_crf` for video quality
* new option `follow_symlinks`, defaults to false, set it to true if you want to use symlink directories

* implemented verbosity levels, default is now 3 = errors, warnings, walkings
* new option `recreate_fixed_height_thumbnails`: makes the scanner delete wide media fixed height thumbnail, in order to get rid of a previous versions bug which caused these thumbnail be generated blurred. Set it to `true`/`1` and make the scanner work, then reset again it to `false`/`0`

### version 2.4.1 (July 26, 2017):

* do not produce canvas for small images: they are shown in their original size
* two new options: `exclude_files_marker` and `exclude_tree_marker`: when the markers are found in a folder, the media in the folder itself or the whole tree isn't scanned

* - php can set page title (by reading the options.json file)
* - php can set the `<link rel"..." ...>` tag in <head></head>, which permits facebook and google+ to show the image when sharing a photo or a video: when sharing an album, php builds an image made of n x n thumbnail (in order to get that, album-size square thumbnails are always generated by python scanner)
* new options `max_album_share_thumbnails_number`: how many thumbnails will be used at most when creating the composite image for sharing albums

* - images/video thumbs can have square (classic behaviour) or fixed height (rectangular thumbnail) type, according to new media_thumb_type option
* more new options:
* - big_date_folders_threshold: doesn't make thumbnails show for date albums too big
* - albums_slide_style (boolean): albums are shown in a simple way or with slide style
* removed options:
* - different_album_thumbnails
* buttons appearing on mouse over are shown persistently on mobile
* landscape photos are shown vertically centered
* if the window is resized, the reduced size image shown is changed according to window size, so that it never shows blurred
* videos now works perfectly in fullscreen mode
* new option `respected_processors`: tells the scanner how many processor not to use

### version 2.1.1 (July 6, 2017):

* new options:
* - persistent_metadata (boolean): permits to have metadata shown persistently on image
* - album_button_background_color
* - album_caption_color

### version 2.1 (July 6, 2017):

* Images and directories can be sorted ascending/descending (via a cookie)

### version 2.0 (July 4, 2017):

* A date tree is builded, permitting photo to be seen by year, month, date
* When a photo is viewed, the user can switch between the folder and the date the photo was taken
* Better error management: if folder is wrong, show root folder; if image is wrong, show album
* In addition to former invocation (with albums and cache paths), `myphotoshare` can be invoked with one parameter: the customization file, which adds many configuration variables;
* web site appearance now is very customizable:
* - choose between cascade, parallel and mixed thumbnails generation
* - fhoose between putting thumbnails in cache dir or in subdir, by 2-letters, from folder md5 or beginning of folder
* - thumbnail can be spaced
* - album thumbnails can be showed different from images ones
