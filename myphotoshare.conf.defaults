# Do not modify this file:

# * then, in _your_ copy:
# * - do not remove nor change the `[options]` marker
# * - set the `physical folders` at the beginning
# * - have fun customizing the other options!
# * - if you want to go back to an option default value, add a leading `#` to the option or remove the line
